This project demonstrates how to load different types of content from URLs in SwiftUI, covering images, web pages, JSON data, and video, all interactively triggered by buttons. This project is designed to complement a YouTube video walkthrough, providing a full code example and explanation of each method.


# Project Overview
In SwiftUI, loading content from a URL can vary depending on the type of content youâ€™re loading.

  This project includes:
- Remote Image Loading using **AsyncImage**
- Web Page Display using **WKWebView**
- JSON Data Fetching from an API using **URLSession**
- Video Playback with **AVPlayer**
Each section is accompanied by a button that, when tapped, will load the respective content type. This setup makes it easy to explore how each component works in SwiftUI.

# Features
- **Remote Image Loading -** Uses AsyncImage to load and display images from a URL asynchronously.
- **WebView for Web Pages -** Wraps WKWebView in UIViewRepresentable to load and display web pages.
- **JSON Data Loading -** Fetches data from a sample JSON API and displays it in a SwiftUI List.
- **Video Player -** Loads and plays a remote video using AVPlayer in a SwiftUI view.


# Getting Started
**Prerequisites**

* Xcode 12 or later (SwiftUI requires iOS 13+, and some components require iOS 15+).
* An active internet connection to load content from the URLs.

# Code Structure
**Each URL loading example is organized in its own SwiftUI view and triggered by a button in the main ContentView:**
1. **RemoteImageView** : Loads an image from a URL using AsyncImage.
2. **WebView** : Displays a web page from a URL using WKWebView.
3. **DataViewModel and User** : Fetches and displays JSON data in a SwiftUI List.
4. **VideoPlayerView** : Plays a video from a URL using AVPlayer.

The main **ContentView** includes buttons to toggle each view, allowing you to dynamically load and display each URL type.
